# MCP Projects Portfolio

A collection of projects demonstrating proficiency with Large Language Model (LLM) agents, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), LangGraph, and LangChain. This portfolio showcases practical implementations of AI agent workflows and tool integrations.

## About

This repository contains hands-on projects exploring modern AI agent frameworks and protocols. Each project demonstrates different aspects of building intelligent systems that can interact with external tools and data sources.

## Technologies & Frameworks

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Open standard for connecting LLMs to external data sources and tools
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications with language models
- **LangGraph**: Library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs
- **OpenAI API**: Large language model integration
- **Python**: Primary development language

### ðŸ”„ Shared Resources
**Location**: `shared/`

Common utilities, configurations, and reusable components across projects.

## Getting Started

Each project contains its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mcp-projects
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Navigate to a specific project**
   ```bash
   cd calculator  # or any other project
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Agent Architecture**: Building multi-step reasoning systems with LangGraph
- **Tool Integration**: Connecting LLMs to external APIs and services via MCP
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation and failure recovery in agent workflows
- **Protocol Implementation**: Working with emerging AI standards like MCP
- **Modern AI Frameworks**: Practical application of LangChain ecosystem

## Academic Context

These projects are part of ongoing coursework and self-directed learning in artificial intelligence and machine learning. They demonstrate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills in the rapidly evolving field of AI agents.

## Future Directions

Planning to expand this portfolio with:
- Multi-agent collaboration systems
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations
- Custom tool development for specific domains
- Integration with vector databases and knowledge graphs

## Contact

This portfolio represents ongoing work in AI agent development and modern LLM frameworks. Each project includes detailed documentation and can be run independently.
